# SSR example
This is an example of the leptos-leaflet-hotline project using leptos and axum.  The example uses server-side rendering.

## Running with NixOS

```bash
nix develop
```

## Without NixOS
This is based on the Leptos Axum Stater Template, which utilizes cargo-leptos.  It requires Rust nightly, and the ability to compile Rust to WASM.  For additional information, see:

[cargo-leptos](https://github.com/akesson/cargo-leptos)
[Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)

The example also uses sass.
